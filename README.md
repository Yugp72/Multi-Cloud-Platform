# Efficient Multi-Cloud Platform: Integrating Services Across Multiple Cloud Platforms

## Project Overview
The **Efficient Multi-Cloud Platform** is designed to manage resources across Google GCP, Amazon AWS, and Microsoft Azure through a single, unified interface. This platform aims to simplify the complexities of multi-cloud management, enhance operational efficiency, and optimize costs for businesses.

## Features
- **Unified Interface**: Manage resources from multiple cloud providers through a single dashboard.
- **Robust APIs**: Seamless integration and CRUD operations across various cloud services using GoLang.
- **Dynamic User Interface**: Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for responsive and user-friendly interactions.
- **Cost Optimization**: Track and manage spending across different cloud providers to enhance financial efficiency.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend Development**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend Development**: GoLang, Node.js, Axios, GraphQL, Apollo Client
- **Database Management**: MySQL
- **Cloud Services API**: GoLang SDKs for AWS, GCP, and Azure
- **Languages**: Go, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Tools**: VS Code, GitHub, Postman

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Start the backend server:
     ```sh
     go run main.go
     ```
3. Start the frontend server:
     ```sh
     npm run dev
     ```

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:
- **frontend**: Contains the Next.js and Tailwind CSS code for building the user interface, responsible for rendering and styling the frontend of the platform.
- **backend**: Contains the GoLang code for API creation, handling server-side logic, and managing integrations with cloud services.
- **database**: Contains the MySQL schema and scripts required for database setup, management, and configuration.

Each directory is modular, allowing for clean separation of concerns and easy maintenance of the platformâ€™s different components.
